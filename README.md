![FE Event DocType](.github/images/fe-event-main-form.png)

Open Source, Powerful, and Comprehensive Event Management Platform

### Stack / Architecture

1. Frappe Framework: The Backend and Admin Interface
2. FrappeUI (based on Vue & TailwindCSS): For the frontend dashboard (for attendee, sponsors, etc.)
3. Frappe Builder: For the public pages like events list and details page.

### The Main Entity

The **FE Event** DocType/Form is the primary entity of the system. Once you have created an event, you can setup ticket types, sponsorship tiers, add-ons (like T-Shirts, Meals, etc.), schedule, and much more!

### Features

This is not an exhaustive list by any means, just to give you an idea ðŸ˜ƒ

#### Dynamic Ticket & Add-on Types

#### The Booking Form

Once you have defined the proper ticket types, add-ons, and publish your event, the booking form will dynamically use it for booking.

#### Payments App Integration

This app depends on Frappe's Payments app for online payments. You can select a Payment Gateway in the event form. BTW GST collection is just a check-box away ðŸ˜‰

#### The Dashboard

#### Ticket Management

The benefits of having a "self-service" dashboard for attendees is that they can modify their bookings on their own (the deadlines can be configured from the **Event Management Settings**). For example, changing their T-Shirt Size after booking:

They can also transfer tickets or request for cancellation.

#### Sponsorship Management

Folks can enquire about sponsoring an event and upon approval from the event management team (from desk), they can directly pay from the dashboard too:

*As soon as they pay, their logo appears on the event page!*
